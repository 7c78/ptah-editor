# Our goals

Fast creation of landing pages for game developers which cover the main distribution aspects: lead generation, presale and sales.

Each ready to use block (we named it `section`) could be tuned with custom elements. Most of properies for each section has they own settings like fonts, background, marging, etc. In same time you don't need to work with low level settings for each element or block you need.
