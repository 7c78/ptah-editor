# Ptah? What is this?

Ptah is a free, powerful and open source Web Builder Framework helping you to fast create modern cross browser landing pages for the games and e-commerce. Mainly Ptah designed to be used as a separate product or like edit component inside CMS to speed up the creation of landing pages. 

Editor and components based on Vue components, created as editable sections with slot elements in it. Editor allow you both to create page prototypes and ready to use pages which are ready to export as [PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) projects in zip arhives ready to deploy on your server. 

# Our goals

Fast creation of landing pages for game developers which cover the main distribution aspects: lead generation, presale and sales. Editor contains ready to use building blocks for such pages â€” tunable `hero section` with variations, `galleries`, `system requirements`, `supported gaming platforms`, `social links`, `lead form`, `presale options`, `footers` and so on.  

Each ready to use block (we named it `section`) could be tuned with custom elements. Most of properies for each section has they own settings like fonts, background, marging, etc. In same time you don't need to work with low level settings for each element or block you need. The page could be composed in few minutes with drag and drop section you need.
