# Ptah editor documentation

#### This is just a start. Proper docs will appear here with time.
Please report all your [questions as issues](/../../issues/new) for now, so we have a clearer idea on what kind of docs to focus on and how verbose our docs need to be.

## Ptah - Vue.js-based landing page builder
![ptah vue.js website builder](/docs/ptah-editor.gif)
Ptah enables marketing experts and designers to produce landing pages without any programmer assitance. Weâ€™ve developed Ptah to be an intuitive tool for creating landing pages where customers can buy and pre-order digital goods and provide leads.

We created Ptah for internal use, and we were able to open source it under a friendly and popular [Apache-2.0 license](/../develop/LICENSE). If you're curious about the context, [here's a blog post at dev.to](https://dev.to/tooevangelist/how-to-open-source-the-company-s-internal-tech-bg0) just about what we're doing and why.

#### Ptah overview:
* Built with Vue.js
* Try out a [demo of Ptah editor](https://ptah.super.com/) that runs on Amazon Cloud
* Check out [a landing page built with Ptah](https://ptah.super.com/) for demo purposes
* Ptah is free and open source under [Apache-2.0 license](/../develop/LICENSE)
* Produces ready to deploy [PWA projects](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/)
* * There's an 'Export' button on the top right corner of our demo to see the exported PWA
* Can be used as a standalone tool or intergrated into your CMS
* Ships with a library of built-in templates that you can extend
* * All our templates feature responsive design out of the box and are mobile-friendly
* Contains multiple ready to use [building blocks](/src/components/sections) 
* * Each building block (a 'section') can be additionally tweaked to your needs and taste
* * Sections support drag-n-drop and live edits

# Getting Started

Ptah can be used as a separate product or as an editor inside a CMS to empower less technical users to create modern and fast landing pages for games or e-commerce.

#### As a first step you're welcome to build Ptah and see what's possible. 

## Install and run
* `yarn install`
* `yarn cjs`
* `gulp locale_sync`
* `gulp public-image`
* `yarn build`

At this point you have a functional Ptah editor that allow you to edit a template and do most things Ptah can do. Very similar to [our provided demo](https://ptah.super.com/), but on your local machine.

However, you cannot export a PWA yet, since you're not logged in. You need to set up a [thin backend](/develop/backend) and this may require quite a bit of setting up. We have a dedicated document to [Ptah backend](backend.md) for your convenience.

## Next steps

Now that you have Ptah up and running, perhaps do see [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md) and consider contributing. All questions, support and feature requests can be [submitted as an issue]/../../issues/new).

A good excersise to get yourself familiar with Ptah code is to add a new section. Start by copying one of the [existing sections](/src/components/sections) and then follow the code in [vuse.js](/src/editor/vuse.js) to see what's happening
