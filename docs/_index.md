## Ptah - Vue.js-based landing page builder
![ptah vue.js website builder](/ptah-editor.jpg)

Ptah is a Vue.js-based open-source game-focused landing page builder framework that combines various ready-to-use templates. 
It is can be used as a separate product or as an editor inside a CMS to empower less technical users to create modern and fast landing pages for games or e-commerce.

Ptah enables marketing experts and designers to produce landing pages without any programmer assitance. Weâ€™ve developed Ptah to be an intuitive tool for creating landing pages where customers can buy and pre-order digital goods and provide leads.

#### Ptah overview:
* Open source under [Apache-2.0 license](/../develop/LICENSE)
* Built with Vue.js
* Produces ready to deploy [PWA projects](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/)
* Can be used as a standalone tool or intergrated into your CMS
* Contains multiple ready to use building blocks such as galleries, system requirements, supported gaming platforms, social links, lead forms, presale options and more
** Each building blog (a 'section') can be additionally tweaked to your needs and taste
** Sections support drag-n-drop and live edits
* Ships with a library of built-in templates that you can extend
** All our templates feature responsive design out of the box and are mobile-friendly

### [A demo is worth a thousand words](https://ptah.super.com/editor/demo)

As you have seen in the demo, Ptah is based on Vue components, created as editable sections with slot elements. You can use the editor to create templates, just like in the demo above, or export ready to deploy [PWA projects](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/).

### [We built our own website with Ptah](https://ptah.super.com/)

We created Ptah for internal use, and we were able to open source it under a friendly and popular license. If you're like what you see, we do inspire you to try out Ptah and perhaps see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), once you're ready to contribute.

## User Authorization
The user authorization process happens in an iframe. You will receive a postMessage from the iframe 
with the result of the authorization.
* Open an `/auth1/login` URL in an iframe to have the user log in
* The result is a postMessage with a json-serialized object with an auth token, expiration time and an error code if it occurs. 
** See the actual structure of the object in [backend/templates/auth1.postmessage.html.template](backend/templates/auth1.postmessage.html.template)
* The auth token shall be stored in the browser's local storage
* Pass the auth token as a bearer authorization header to all requests to the Ptah API.

To refresh a page you can send a GET request to `/auth1/refresh` to get a json response with an updated token. 

To logout you can send a refresh token as a "refresh" header and the access token as a bearer authorization in a GET request to 
`/auth1/logout`

## Mailchimp linking

You can link your MailChip account to collect your visitor emails on on your landing page.

* Open an `/mailchimp/login` url in an iframe to have the user log in
* The result is a postMessage with a json-serialized object with success sign and an error code if it occurs. 
** See the actual structure of the object in [backend/templates/mailchimp.postmessage.html.template](backend/templates/auth1.postmessage.html.template)
