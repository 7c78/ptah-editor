## Become a contributor

You can contribute to Ptah in several ways. Here are some examples:

- Report bugs.
- Contribute to the Ptah codebase.
- Write technical documentation and blog posts, for users and contributors.
- Help others by answering questions about Ptah.

Contributing to open source can be a rewarding way to learn, teach, and build experience in just about any skill you can imagine. [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) is a great one to get you inspired.

### Report bugs

Report bugs and issues by submitting a [bug report](https://github.com/ProtocolONE/ptah-editor/issues/new?labels=type%3A+bug&template=1-bug_report.md). Make sure that you provide as much information as possible on how to reproduce the bug.

### Feature Requests and support

If you have an idea of how to improve Ptah or have general feedback, you're welcome to submit a [feature request](https://github.com/ProtocolONE/ptah-editor/issues/new?labels=type%3A+feature+request&template=2-feature_request.md).

Chances are, you like what we have already but you may require a custom integration, a special license or something else big and specific to your needs that our community may not benefit from. We're generally open to such conversations.

If you have a question and can't find the answer yourself, you can [raise an issue](https://github.com/ProtocolONE/ptah-editor/issues/new) and describe what exactly you're trying to do. We'll do our best to reply in a meaningful time.

### Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

At this very moment, we're working on the CLA. Until it is ready we may be on the slower side in accepting your contributions.

### Where do I go from here?

The documentation for Ptah is in the works. Until we're happy to roll it out to the public, please refer to [the readme doc](README.md) that offers a good starting point in setup up the development environment and getting started with Ptah.
